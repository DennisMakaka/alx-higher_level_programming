# Python Classses and Objects

## OVerview
 This project is a hands-on exploration of python's OOP features, specifically focusing on classes and objects. It covers fundamental concepts, attributes, methods and advanced topics like encapsulation, polymophism, abstraction and inheritance. 

## Learning objectives
 By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the significance of Python programming.
- Grasp the fundamentals of OOP, including classes and objects.
- Differentiate between classes and instances.
- Work with attributes, access modifiers, and methods.
- Implement data abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding.
- Define and use properties in Python.
- Follow Pythonic conventions for writing getters and setters.
- Dynamically create and bind attributes to objects and classes.
 
## Project structure
The project is organized as follows:

- **src/:** Contains the Python source code files.
- **tests/:** Includes test cases for validating the functionality of classes and objects.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview and guide to the project.

## Requirements

- Python version: 3.8.5
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Code Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Code Style: PEP 8 using pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

## Documentation

- All modules, classes, and methods must contain docstrings as comments.
- Use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'` to check module documentation.
- Use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'` to check class documentation.
- Use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'` to check function documentation.
