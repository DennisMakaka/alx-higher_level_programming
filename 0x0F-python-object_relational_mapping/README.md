# Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

## Overview
- Welcome to the Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) project! This project aims to bridge the gap between Python applications and relational databases, simplifying data management and interaction through the use of SQLAlchemy.
## Features 
 1. ORM Abstraction - Utilize the power of SQLAlchemy, a robust ORM library, to abstract away the complexities of database interactions. Write Python code instead of SQL queries to interact with your database.
 2. Flexible Database Support - With SQLAlchemy, you can seamlessly connect to MySQL databases, enabling you to switch between different database backends without rewriting your application code.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- MySQLdb 2.0.x
- SQLAlchemy 1.4.x
- pycodestyle 2.8.* for code style enforcement
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS for execution environment
